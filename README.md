This is a Python script that implements an enhanced color prediction system using both machine learning and probabilistic approaches. Here’s a breakdown of its functionalities:

Neural Network: The script defines a simple neural network (SimpleNN) for predicting the next color based on historical color data. The neural network consists of multiple layers, using ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.

Random Forest Classifier: It also employs a Random Forest Classifier to analyze color sequences and make predictions.

Markov Chain: A Markov chain model is used to predict the next color based on the most recent color. This model utilizes probabilities derived from the historical color transitions.

Pattern Recognition: The program can analyze complex patterns from historical data to make predictions. It retains a record of color sequences and can identify commonly occurring patterns.

Anomaly Detection: The script incorporates mechanisms to detect anomalies in the color sequences based on defined thresholds.

Learning Rate Adjustment: It adjusts the learning rate of the neural network based on the model’s performance over time.

History Management: The class can save and load color history from color_history.json file, allowing it to retain state across different runs.

Interactive Interface: The main() function provides a command-line interface where users can input colors, view statistics, and receive predictions.
